# GTDC Insurance Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive assessment of insurance data provided in four separate files. The main objective was to clean, transform, and analyze the data using Python in Jupyter Notebook. This project demonstrates essential data handling, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.

## Data Description
The dataset contains four files with information related to insurance policies, customer details, claims, and premiums. The files represent raw data requiring significant preprocessing before meaningful analysis. Key tasks included merging datasets, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

## Objectives
1. Perform **data cleaning** and **transformation** to prepare the data for analysis.
2. Conduct **basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights and trends within the dataset.
3. Document findings and prepare visualizations to communicate insights effectively.

## Key Features of Implementation
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent entries.
   - Standardized data formats for numerical and categorical variables.
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries.
2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Merged multiple files into a single structured dataset.
   - Created new calculated fields to support analysis.
   - Applied encoding for categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized key metrics like policy trends, claim amounts, and customer demographics.
   - Identified patterns such as correlations between premium values and claims.
   - Analyzed the distribution of categorical and numerical variables.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Repository Contents
- **Data Files:** Four CSV files containing raw insurance data.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Python notebook detailing data cleaning, transformation, and analysis steps.
- **Results:** Visualizations and summaries derived from EDA.

## Results and Insights
1. **Claims Analysis:**
   - Identified top claim categories by frequency and total amount.
   - Highlighted customers with unusually high claims.
2. **Policy Trends:**
   - Analyzed active policies over time.
   - Explored patterns in premiums across customer demographics.
3. **Customer Insights:**
   - Segmented customers based on age, gender, and region.
   - Correlated customer features with claims and premiums.

## Limitations and Future Work
- **Limitations:**
   - The dataset lacked some details that could enhance deeper analysis (e.g., customer income).
   - Assumptions were made for certain missing values.
- **Future Enhancements:**
   - Integrate external datasets to enrich analysis (e.g., regional statistics).
   - Develop predictive models to estimate claims and optimize premiums.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Load the provided Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the step-by-step analysis documented in the notebook.
